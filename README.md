# JSALT

# The L_to_IPA folder contains the code used to convert a specific language's characters to their 
# IPA pronunciations. We used a subset of the IPA set 

#To create a Language Model, used Preethi's code on a text file consisting of our universal IPA characters.
#We first converted sbs text, native transcription text, or wikipidea text into IPA using the 
#python code **_phones_**.py, where the first character sequence denotes the text source, and the second
#character sequence denotes the targeted language.
#We passed the Language to IPA converted text to Preethi's code to create a Language Model.

#Results has Language Model performance repots.
